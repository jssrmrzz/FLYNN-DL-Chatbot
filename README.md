FLYNN is a chatbot project to help learn about the process of developing an intelligent chatbot from the ground up. FLYNN will be coded using Python and we will being using the Neural Intents library for Deep Learning. The chatbot will be deployed in my Discord Test Server for demonstration and will eventually be residing in my public server to provide entertainment for my members.
